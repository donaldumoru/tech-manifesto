            >young age</span
          >, I have always been captivated by technology. Whether it was
          <span class="hover-image-past" data-image="images/ps2.jpg"
            >video games</span
          >,
          <span class="hover-image-past" data-image="images/indiana.jpg"
            >western movies</span
          >, or just being able to surf the web, technology always felt like a
          source of entertainment. In hindsight, while technology seemed like
          just a tool for fun, it also subtly introduced me to different
          cultures and global perspectives. Technology evolved and
          <span class="hover-image-past" data-image="images/3310.jpg"
            >phones</span
          >
          came and gradually, just having fun and playing with technology
          started to grow into an interest in wanting to know "<span
            class="hover-image-past"
            data-image="images/thinking.png"
            >How are these amazing things made?</span
          >" The moment I realized that I could also create with technology, it
          sparked a lifelong journey of learning and experimentation. This for
          me, marked the beginning of my desire to not just consume technology,
          but to also actively contribute to shaping it.

          longer just about playing with gadgets. Being far away from family and
          friends, technology keeps us connected. From

            >smartphones</span
          >
          have evolved, a lot of apps now substitute for traditional social
          life. I recently had to make a conscious decision to go back to
          reading
          <span class="hover-image-present" data-image="images/books.jpg"
            >physical books</span

            >e-books</span
          >. I even have a

            >toothbrush tool</span
          >
          that I use every morning to randomly pick what toothbrush to use for
          the day. I don't just want to consume technology but I also want to
          create with it. I am a very independent and I aim to build my own
          projects, free from the constraints of working for someone else.

        <h1>The Future</h1>

        <p class="bottom-text">
          The future is uncertain, and that also makes it exciting I don’t know
          what new challenges or opportunities will arise, but I envision a
          future where technology will be there to help solve the problems. I am
          not trying to predict the future like a philosopher; rather, as a
          creator, I see technology as a tool to adapt, solve real-world
          problems, and improve people’s lives. My vision and goal for the
          future is to be able to contribute to the AR/VR space and improve how
          we communicate with loved ones, and make online interactions feel more
          like physical meetings. I see a future where we will have realistic
          holograms for more personal conversations. With the world becoming
          more multicultural and a lot of people migrating to different parts of
          the world, long term, I believe AR/VR will revolutionize how we
          communicate with loved ones, and make virtual interactions feel more
          like physical meetings. I believe this will strengthen relationships
          and make online conversations even more personal. These technologies
          could also be used for for workplaces, where people can work from home
          and still get the feeling of going physically to work.
